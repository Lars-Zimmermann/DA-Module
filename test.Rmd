```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Introduction

These are my first steps with _R Markdown_ and I learned the basics in the **DA module**. The [materials](https://cory-whitney.shinyapps.io/Decision_Analysis_Course/) of this course can be find at:  <https://cory-whitney.shinyapps.io/Decision_Analysis_Course/>.

I will show some visualizations on the R **diamonds** data set. This data set contains information about the attributes of diamonds `r nrow(diamonds)`. 

```{r diamonds}
summary(diamonds)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
